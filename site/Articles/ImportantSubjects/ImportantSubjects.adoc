== String View

`std::string_view` is a non-owning reference to a contiguous sequence of characters, introduced in C++17 to improve efficiency in string handling.

=== Benefits
* Avoids unnecessary allocations and copies of `std::string`
* Supports standard string operations without modifying the original data
* Improves performance by working with existing character buffers

=== Recommended CppCon Talks
*  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEvkBmuMIr8[*How to Use string_view in C++* (CppCon 2024)] – Jasmine Lopez & Prithvi Okade explain the fundamentals of string_view, its advantages over std::string, comparisons with std::span, and best practices for efficient string handling.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9gAaNRoon4[*CppCon 2015: Marshall Clow - string_view*] – Covers the introduction of string_view in the Library Fundamentals TS, explaining its purpose and how it improves performance by avoiding unnecessary string copies.

=== Code Example
[source,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

void print(std::string_view sv) {
    std::cout << "StringView: " << sv << '\n';
}

int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello, C++!";
    print(str);  // Avoids extra copies
}
----

=== Summary
Using `std::string_view` enhances efficiency in string processing by reducing unnecessary memory operations while maintaining easy-to-use string functionality.

== Move semantics

Here are some great *CppCon* talks on move semantics:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt3zcJZIalk[Back to Basics: Move Semantics - Nicolai Josuttis - CppCon 2021]: A deep dive into move semantics, covering lvalues, rvalues, move constructors, and std::move. This talk explains why move semantics improve performance in C++.

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knEaMpytRMA[Back to Basics: C++ Move Semantics - Andreas Fertig - CppCon 2022]: A practical session that demystifies move semantics with clear examples and best practices.

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUsQPIoYoRM[Moved-from Objects in C++ - Jon Kalb - CppCon 2024]: Focuses on the state of moved-from objects and how to write better C++ code using move semantics.
